Library
=======

Purpose: completed as part of the Epicodus curriculum. Working with databases. 

* As a librarian, I want to create, read, update, delete, and lists books in the catalog, so that we can keep track of our inventory.
* As a librarian, I want to search for a book by author or title, so that I can find a book when there are a lot of books in the library.
* As a librarian, I want to enter multiple authors for a book, so that I can include accurate information in my catalog. (Hint: make an authors table and a books table with a many-to-many relationship.)
* As a patron, I want to check a book out, so that I can take it home with me.
